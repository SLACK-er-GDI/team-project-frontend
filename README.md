## The Devlopment Story
 - **The Development Process**
 - The development process started with some rough wireframes, some user
   stories, and a quick planning outline. We divided development into feature
   groups and created a branch in Git for each group.  We pushed and merged to dev often and used pull requests to review work.  We worked mostly in pairs and worked on some features individually.  We ran into some issues with security with our 3rd party Filestack application.

 - **Problem-Solving Strategy**
 - We used the debugging facilities in the DevTools. We analyized error messages, setup breakpoints, and stepped through the code examining values of objects as we stepped through.  We worked as a full team to go through the full planning process prior to starting the project and worked in pairs or more when attemping to work through harder problems we encountered.

## Current Issues to be resolved in the future
- **Future Enhancements**

- Allow uers to search by tags and other search functionality
- Add default images for file types other than images
